# todochainz
A blockchain-based todo application

It's intended as a way to learn blockchain technology and to practice using Go.

Todochainz uses the following packages:
  [Spew](https://github.com/davecgh/go-spew) for logging struct data to the console
  [Plush](https://github.com/gobuffalo/plush) for html template rendering
  [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) for route multiplexing
  [Godotenv](https://github.com/joho/godotenv) for environment variables

Todochainz was inspired by and heavily based on the excellent post [Code your own blockchain in less than 200 lines of Go!](https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/code-your-own-blockchain-in-less-than-200-lines-of-go-e296282bcffc) from Coral Health.
